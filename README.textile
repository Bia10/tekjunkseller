tekJunkSeller is a simple addon that automatically sells all your grey items when you visit a vendor.  No config, install and go.

There is a single grey item in the game that starts a quest.  If you're questing in Swamp of Sorrows, watch out for "%{color:#9d9d9d}[Noboru's Cudgel]%":http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6196.
